-  **Quanbing Luo**; Ting Ren;  Dong Liang, Discretized pressure Poisson algorithm for the steady incompressible flow on a nonstaggered grid, [Numerical Heat Transfer, Part B: Fundamentals](https://doi.org/10.1080/10407790.2017.1326773), 2017, 71(6): 549-559.


<!-- [Engineering with Computers](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-020-01262-x), 2021 (Published Online) -->

The source code is divided to two parts: (1) SourceCode and (2) Data&Figure. 

## (1) SourceCode

It is the source code (write in C++) of the discretized pressure Poisson algorithm for the steady incompressible flow on a nonstaggered grid.  
 

 
## (2) Data&Figure

It includes the  data generated from the C++ source code and MATLAB figure programs . 

For more information about the detailed algorithm, please read the published paper.   


<!-- **Notice:** The source code does not provide data files. You should generate the data files step by step. There is a Figure.m program in each program directory to draw the figure of generated data.    -->
